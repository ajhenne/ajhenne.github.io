        My enjoyment for coding was first discovered playing Roblox growing up as a kid. First taking apart and
        reconfiguring other people's scripts, before somewhat finding my own feet, allowing me to build various bases,
        laser guns and spaceships.

        I could not pinpoint any exact moment I fell in love with space. I just seem to always remember loving it.
        Whether that was watching astronomy documentaries, or playing any of the number of space-based games I've had
        over the years. o7
